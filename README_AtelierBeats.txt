Ciao ragazzi,

come ci eravamo messi d'accordo ho messo su git il mio atelier beats, cosi che lo possiamo usare come base per il nostro progetto. 
Vi scrivo qui in basso i feedback dei miei assignment 3 e 6 così che potete vedere tutti cosa manca o cosa c’è di sbagliato e di modo che ognuno sappia esattamente cosa gli manca da aggiungere o sistemare della sua parte.

Feedback hm3:
Ex1: 271a) You are only checking for the variables to be undefined, but not if they are null or empty string (""""). Ideally, by calling one of your constructors with all empty strings as input variables you should get an error, not an object.Ex2: 522d) You should populate the Library view from the model when the page loads. Having top-level urls like /AtelierBeats makes assumption about the server that is hosting your site, try to have relative urls starting from your root html file. I would define a better style for the Album and the Artist view. You did not use the id of the Artist/Album to reference to the Track's Artist/Album. As a consequence here you did not resolve the _ids to populate the Library view. 2f) Nice use of timeupdate and loadedmetadata, see comment in 6 for the time formatEx3: 13a) In savePlaylist, if there's no playlists property in localStorage this 'if(playlist.length == ""undefined""){' will fail because playlist is undefined. Make sure you check if localStorage.playlists exists. If not initialize it. In line 181 of app.js you expect 'playlist' to be an Array. In the next line you do 'playlist[pl._id] = pl;' whre pl._id is not an Integer (it is a string in your case). Arrays in javascript should only be indexed by Intergers. If you want to index by string use a regular object( In javascript 'Hashmap' and 'Dictionary' are considered to be the same thing as an regular object). So you would have to do playlist = {}; By the way, if you do JSON.stringify on an array the expected (and correct) behaviour is to only get the integer indexed elements. That's why when you try to save it on localStorage it fails.Ex4: 0Ex5: 0Ex6: 86.3) 3.85 minutes is not a time value you would expect from a player. 03:51 would be more reasonable 6.4) Volume bar should be initialized in the correct position (the audio starts with volume 100% so the slider should be to the right)TOTAL: 88
